# DependencyCheck

_**This utility will be changing: right now it just duplicates functionality that's already in the Maven Dependency plugin. In its next revision, it will (1) recursively inspect the call graph to classify dependencies as direct or transitive, (2) look in the user's repository for later versions of dependencies, and (3) if possible, look in Maven Central for later versions of dependencies.**_

Examines the bytecode of project classes to determine which third-party classes are invoked, then examines the
project dependencies to find those classes. Writes two lists to StdOut: those classes thata are not found in
any direct dependencies, and those direct dependencies that are not referenced by the application classes.

## Invocation

    java -jar app-dependency.jar [OPTIONS]

## Options

* `--projectDirectory=DIR`

    Selects a project directory for the check. By default, checks the current directory.

* `--ignoreUnusedDependency=GROUPID[:ARTIFACTID]`

    Removes dependencies from the "unused dependency" list. This is used if you load classes via
    reflection: since the dependency scanner looks for explicit references within the classfile,
    it will report a false positive if you use reflection to load classes (or call methods that
    do).

    Another source of false positives are libraries, like `spring-test`, that do not properly
    manage their own dependencies (ie, they mark a dependency as "provided," or assume that it
    will be fulfilled from a transitive dependency that's marked as such).

* `--reportUnusedRuntimeDependencies`

    By default, dependencies with scope `runtime` are removed from the unused dependencies list;
    they're expected to be unused. This option is useful if you want to actually see how many of
    this type of dependency are in your POM (and determine whether they're actually needed at
    runtime).

## Notes

* This utility must be run *after* building the project. It examines project classes in the `target` directory,
  and looks for dependencies in the local repository. It will not attempt to retrieve any missing dependencies.

## Roadmap

* Maintain a pre-configured set of "expected" unused dependencies. This is to cover cases (such as `spring-test` and `spring-core`)
    where the direct dependency has a runtime transitive dependency that is not specified in its own POM (and must
    therefore be specified as a direct dependency in the project POM).
* Add option to ignore unused dependencies where the scope is `provided` or `optional` (currently we consider these compile-time
    dependencies, so they're ignored by default).
* Handle dependencies with scope `system`.
* Support artifact qualifiers
