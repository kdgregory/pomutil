# Cleaner

Cleaner takes a single POM and cleans it up according to your options.

## Invocation

    java -jar app-dependency.jar [OPTIONS] [INFILE [[OUTFILE]]

## Options

* Add common properties

    Disable with: `--noCommonProps`

    There are some standard properties, such as build encoding, that Maven complains about if missing. This
    step adds them, creating a `<properties>` section if necessary.

* Normalize `dependency` specifications

    Disable with: `--noDependencyNormalize`

    Ensures that the children of the `dependency` element follow the order given in the
    [Maven docs](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.0.4/maven-model/maven.html#class_dependency) (most important being that
    `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` come first and in that order), and removes any `<scope>compile</scope>`
    or `<type>jar</type>` elements (because these are the defaults).

* Order dependencies

    Disable with: `--noDependencySort`

    Modify with: `--groupDependenciesByScope`

    Sorts the `<dependency>` entries within `<dependencies>` and `<dependencyManagement>` top-level sections. Sort
    is alphabetic, by combining group ID, artifact ID, and version (although version should never come into play).

    If the `--groupDependenciesByScope` option is provided, dependencies are first sorted by their `<scope>` value,
    in the order `compile` (or blank), `test`, `runtime`, `provided`, `system`.

    Note that this step completely rebuilds the container elements, and will remove any blank lines or comments
    between entries.

* Convert explicit dependency versions to properties

    Disable with: `--noVersionProps`

    Modify with: `--addArtifactIdToProp=GROUPID`, `--replaceExistingProps`, `--noConvertPluginVersions`

    Finds all dependency references that use explicit numeric versions, and converts those dependencies to use
    a property. These properties are appended to the `<properties>` section in alphabetical order, with plugin
    versions following normal dependencies. If there is no existing `<properties>` section, one will be appened
    to the POM, and the properties added to it.

    Existing dependency properties will be checked for collisions but otherwise ignored. To make all of your dependencies
    use the same format, use the `--replaceExistingProps` option.

    Property names for standard dependencies are formed by appending ".version" to the dependency's group ID (eg:
    "`com.example.verson`"). If the same group ID is associated with two version numbers, then the property for
    *the second and subsequent* instances will be constructed with the artifact ID (eg: first dependency is
    "`com.example.verson`" second is "`com.example.foo.verson`").  These collisions will be logged.

    If you know that you have multiple artifacts with the same group ID and different versions, you can provide one or
    more "`--addArtifactIdToProp=GROUPID`" options. The properties for all dependencies in this group will have the
    artifact ID as part of their name.

    Because many plugins share the same group ID (`org.apache.maven.plugins`), property names for plugins use the form
    `plugin.ARTIFACTID.version`, with `plugin.ARTIFACTID-VERSION.version` used if there is a duplicate (which should
    never happen). You can disable conversion of plugin properties with the `--noConvertPluginVersions` option.

    Note: dependency versions within plugin specifications are *not* replaced by properties. This is because these versions
    are presumed to differ from the main dependencies.


* Normalize `plugin` elements

    Disable with: `--noPluginNormalize`

    Ensures that plugin specifications follow the form shown in the [Maven docs], and adds defaulted `groupId` elements.


* Organize top-level POM elements (disabled by default)

    Enable with: `--organizePom`

    Re-orders top-level POM elements per the [POM definition](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.0.4/maven-model/maven.html).
    Any top-level comments or processing instructions will be removed by this step. The children of these top-level
    elements will not be affected.

    This operation uses the classpath resource `proto-pom.xml` to control re-organization. Edit this file if you want
    to see a different layout. Any elements that are in the prototype but not your actual POM are ignored.

    Elements in your POM that are not in the prototype will be re-inserted at the end of the POM. This feature is
    intended to support new components added by Maven (and not yet incorporated into the prototype).


* Pretty-print output

    Disable with: `--noPrettyPrint`

    Removes all "ignorable whitespace" from the POM, then writes the output using an indenting serializer. Note that this
    will remove any blank lines between sections.

    By default, the indentation is 4 spaces per level. You can change this with the option `--prettyPrint=NUM`, where
    `NUM` is the number of spaces you want.

## Roadmap

*   Remove duplicate dependencies (this already happens during sorting)
*   Convert plugin-specific dependency versions to properties. Will use a property name of the form
    `GROUPID[.ARTIFACTID].pluginversion`.
*   Create empty version properties for plugins that don't have explicit versions, and flag them.
*   Add explicit version numbers to plugins (disabled by default). This will be based on a configuration file that's
    irregularly updated from on [Maven documentation](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html), and may be modified
    by the user.
*   Insert lines between sections in pretty-printed output. This will require abandoning the JAXP pretty-printer, as it
    gets confused when there's already inter-element whitespace.
